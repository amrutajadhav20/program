<div>A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea <p class="p">Hello World</p> 
</div>
<div>It is important to note that a paragraph does not have a minimum or maximum number of sentences that it must have to fit the definition of a paragraph. Some writers will opt to use very short paragraphs, while others will include dozens of sentences in their paragraphs. It is also important to know that most writers separate lines of dialogue into paragraphs, so if a character only speaks a single line, it will be its own paragraph.<p class="q">Quastech</p>
